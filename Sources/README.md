# Dumplier - Sources

The current state of dumplier. Other folders are just preparation exercise and
studying documentation.

## Project Structure

- `dumplier/` - my tiny kernel from [OS-dev Bare-Bones](../bare-bones/README.md).
But it seems to take ages to finish it;

## TODO

- <https://wiki.osdev.org/User:TheCool1Kevin/VSCode_Debug> - set up VSCode
- <https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones> - make pretty output functions
- <https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Paging> - set UP paging
- <https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Paging_With_PAE> - set up PAE
