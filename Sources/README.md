# Dumplier - Sources

The current state of dumplier. Other folders are just preparation exercise and
studying documentation.

## Project Structure

- `dumplier/` - my tiny kernel from [OS-dev Bare-Bones](../bare-bones/README.md).
But it seems to take ages to finish it;
- `memtest86+-scraper` - little hack to try to make the 64bit scrapper from
[memtest86+](https://www.memtest.org/).
